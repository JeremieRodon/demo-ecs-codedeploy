# Changelog

All notable changes to the ECS CodeDeploy Demo project are documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### üöÄ Major Architecture Refactor

This release represents a complete architectural overhaul of the ECS CodeDeploy demo, introducing a two-stack approach with automated CI/CD pipeline and significant usability improvements.

### ‚ú® Added

#### New Infrastructure Architecture
- **Two-Stack Approach**: Split infrastructure into foundations and application stacks
  - `1-demo-fundations.yaml`: VPC, ECS cluster, ECR repository, Custom Resources Lambda functions
  - `2-demo-application.yaml`: ECS application, ALB, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, EventBridge integration
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Full CodePipeline integration with automatic deployments
- **EventBridge Integration**: ECR push events automatically trigger CodePipeline
- **CodePipeline Orchestration**: Automated deployment pipeline replacing manual Lambda triggers
- **Sequential Deployment Safety**: CodePipeline ensures strict ordering, eliminating race conditions from rapid successive ECR pushes

#### New Scripts and Tooling
- `deploy.sh`: Complete deployment script orchestrating all infrastructure
- `cleanup.sh`: Root-level cleanup script for the entire demo
- `scripts/deploy-foundations.sh`: Dedicated foundations stack deployment
- `scripts/deploy-application.sh`: Dedicated application stack deployment

#### Enhanced Integration Testing
- **Pipeline Integration**: Integration tests now run as part of CodePipeline
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better test failure detection and rollback mechanisms
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: CodePipeline execution tracking and logging

### üîÑ Changed

#### Infrastructure Changes
- **Runtime Upgrade**: Lambda functions upgraded from Python 3.9 to Python 3.13
- **Timeout Optimization**: Integration test timeout reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
- **Termination Wait**: Reduced from 5 minutes to 1 minute after successful deployment
- **ECR Management**: ECR repository now managed in foundations stack instead of separate stack

#### Deployment Flow
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single `./deploy.sh` command replaces multi-step process
- **Automatic Image Building**: v1.0 image automatically built and pushed if ECR is empty
- **Pipeline-Driven**: Deployments now triggered through CodePipeline instead of direct Lambda calls
- **Event-Driven**: ECR push ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí CodePipeline ‚Üí CodeDeploy workflow
- **Deployment Ordering**: CodePipeline queues deployments sequentially, preventing crashes from concurrent operations

#### Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite with new architecture and simplified quick start
- **CLEANUP.md**: Updated for new two-stack approach and consolidated cleanup
- **INTEGRATION_TESTING.md**: Enhanced with CodePipeline integration details

#### Script Improvements
- **Consolidated Scripts**: All deployment scripts moved to root level
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and validation
- **Consistent Naming**: Updated script paths and stack names throughout

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

#### Deprecated Files
- `cloudformation/cleanup.sh`: Replaced by root-level cleanup script
- `cloudformation/demo-stack.yaml`: Split into foundations and application stacks
- `cloudformation/deploy-ecr.sh`: ECR deployment integrated into foundations stack
- `cloudformation/deploy.sh`: Replaced by root-level deploy script
- `cloudformation/ecr-stack.yaml`: Merged into foundations stack

#### Simplified Architecture
- **Single Stack Deployment**: Eliminated separate ECR stack deployment step
- **Direct Lambda Triggers**: Replaced with automated CodePipeline orchestration (eliminates race conditions)
- **Complex Multi-Step Setup**: Simplified to single command deployment
- **Concurrent Deployment Issues**: Eliminated Lambda crashes from simultaneous CodeDeploy attempts

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Faster Deployments**: Reduced timeout and wait periods
- **Streamlined Testing**: More efficient integration test execution
- **Better Resource Management**: Optimized stack dependencies and cleanup
- **Deployment Reliability**: CodePipeline's sequential processing prevents race conditions from rapid ECR pushes

#### Security Enhancements
- **Updated Runtime**: Python 3.13 with latest security patches
- **Improved IAM Policies**: More granular permissions for pipeline components

#### Developer Experience
- **Single Command Deploy**: Complete infrastructure setup with `./deploy.sh`
- **Automatic Setup**: No manual ECR repository creation required
- **Better Validation**: Enhanced setup validation and error reporting
- **Consistent Paths**: All scripts callable from project root
- **Rapid Deployment Safety**: Can now safely push multiple versions in quick succession without conflicts

### üìä Statistics

- **Files Changed**: 12 files modified
- **Lines Added**: ~2,000 lines of new CloudFormation templates and scripts
- **Lines Removed**: ~1,420 lines of deprecated code
- **Net Change**: +580 lines (significant architectural improvements)

### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users
1. **Cleanup Old Infrastructure**: Run cleanup script to remove old stacks
2. **Redeploy with New Architecture**: Use `./deploy.sh` for complete setup
3. **Update Script Paths**: All scripts now callable from project root
4. **Review New Documentation**: README.md has been completely rewritten

#### Breaking Changes
- **Stack Names Changed**:
  - `ecs-codedeploy-demo` ‚Üí `ecs-codedeploy-demo-application`
  - `ecs-codedeploy-demo-ecr` ‚Üí `ecs-codedeploy-demo-foundations`
- **Script Locations**: All deployment scripts moved to root level
- **Deployment Process**: Multi-step manual process replaced with single command

### üéØ Benefits

#### Operational Excellence
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single command deployment eliminates multi-step confusion
- **Automated Pipeline**: ECR push automatically triggers full deployment pipeline
- **Better Monitoring**: CodePipeline provides clear deployment status and history
- **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and rollback mechanisms
- **Sequential Processing**: Eliminates race conditions - rapid successive deployments are now safe and reliable

#### Cost Optimization
- **Faster Deployments**: Reduced timeout periods minimize Lambda execution costs
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Better stack organization and cleanup procedures
- **CodePipeline Costs**: Added pipeline execution costs but improved automation value

#### Security & Compliance
- **Latest Runtime**: Python 3.13 ensures latest security patches
- **Granular Permissions**: Improved IAM policies following least privilege principle
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better audit trails through CodePipeline integration

### üîÆ Future Enhancements

This architecture provides a solid foundation for future improvements:
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- Advanced deployment strategies (canary, linear)
- Integration with additional AWS services
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities

**Migration Timeline**: Existing users should plan for a complete redeployment as this is a breaking change that requires infrastructure recreation.

**Support**: For questions or issues with the migration, please refer to the updated documentation or create an issue in the repository.
